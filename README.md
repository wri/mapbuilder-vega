# mapbuilder-vega

This is a repository for hosting the configurations for the Vega Widgets which are used in the GFW MapBuilder application.

The Vega widgets are stored in the [Resource Watch API](https://resource-watch.github.io/doc-api/index-rw.html), and can be updated through requests via Postman or another API client. The endpoint for posting new widgets is *https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/<dataset_id>/widget*
